# unstructured

## Mission
Make the world's unstructured data more useful to AI.

## Problem Statement
As the tide of AI rises, as our reasoning engines get more powerful, the bottleneck becomes data. AI will evolve, improving its ability to leverage diverse datasets. Large language models will adeptly utilize ambiguous, underspecified, and chaotic data. The crux? The quality and availability of unstructured data.

To revolutionize AI, we must meet its data needs. We must arm it with data that pushes its pattern-matching abilities to the limit. Here lies the challenge for data engineers, data scientists, and software & devops engineers. By coming together, we can shape the future of AI.

## The Plan
Yet to be outlined.

## what We Believe
- True, scientific reasoning will emerge from larger AI systems.
- Increasingly, the data engineering role will be the bottleneck of AI. Everyone team will need a data engineer, or have some one who can effectively become one (so we need better tools)
- Open collaboration is the way forward.
- The data community holds immense potential.
- In [Dataism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataism#:~:text=Dataism%20is%20a%20term%20that,New%20York%20Times%20in%202013).
- Tools must be built to empower the open data community.
