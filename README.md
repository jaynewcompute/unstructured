## Unstructured Thoughts

### Mission
- Make the world's unstructured data more useful to AI
- Prepare the world's unstructured data for AI
- Encode the structure in the world's unstructured data

### Problem Statement
Natural language reasoning engines, like LLMs, are the most important technological development of our lifetimes, for a few reasons:

1) Reasoning is the highest-leverage force in the universe
2) LLMs will likely be able to reason about, and virtualize, a wide variety of important systems, like physics, biology, chemistry, people, computers, etc, through the interface of natural language
3) Making all of the world's knowledge semantically searchable, to apply that reasoning, will be the most democratizing shift since the printing press 

If we're on the same page about the above, the next question is, how do we get there?

That's becoming more and more clear: the biggest bottleneck to powerful, democratized reasoning is the availability of high quality data. AI will get better at reasoning, and we will get better at piping AI into more places, but the majority of mission-critical, useful information is stuck in unstructured data. In other words, as machines become more intelligent, the value of unstructured data goes exponential. 

Increasing the amount of accessible, useful unstructured data is the most important thing in all of AI.

The goal of this memo is to activate and mobilize the most important community, in the most important race: the data community. If we want to bring the future forward, if we want accelerate the proliferation of productive artificial reasoning, we need the data community to mobilize. If we want to solve the world's problems, cure diseases, unbreak the economy, fix global crises, and make scientific breakthroughs, we need to make sure unstructured data meets AI closer to where it's at. We need to unleash the power of machine reasoning on everything. And we are limited only by what we can "feed" it. And the biggest bottleneck in the quality and availability of what we can feed it is new tools and techniuqes.

"Progress in science depends on new techniques, new discoveries and new ideas, probably in that order" - Sidney Brenner

If we, as a community of engineers and data scientists can come together and build a new set of tools. If we encourage the liberation of private, siloed data. If we improve humanities ability to make unstructured data useful. We can bring the future forward. It's not going to be easy, it's not going to happen over night, but needles are going to be moved. 


### The Plan
Yet to be outlined.

### A Few Things We Believe
- Bona fide, human-level reasoning will be an emergent property that arises out of the next few generations LLMs
- The data engineering role will be the primary bottleneck
- Every team will need a data engineer, or have some one who can effectively become onw.
- Building better tools will close the gap faster than convincing more people to specialize in data engineering
- Open, community-led collaborative efforts are the way forward.
- The data community holds immense potential
- [Dataism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataism#:~:text=Dataism%20is%20a%20term%20that,New%20York%20Times%20in%202013) is sick

### Inspiration
- The Airbyte community, and what they have done for strucured data
- LlamaIndex community, and what the framework they've built
- Unstructured.io community, and their work with the public sector
- LangChain community, and their efforts in making LLMs more accessible
