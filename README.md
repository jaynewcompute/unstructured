### Mission
Bring structure to the world's unstrucutured data


### Problem Statement
Natural language reasoning engines, like LLMs, are the most important technological development of our lifetimes, for a few reasons:

1) Reasoning is the foundation of all leverage
2) LLMs will likely be able to reason about, and virtualize, a wide variety of important systems (e.g. physics, biology, chemistry, people, computers, the mess of the healthcare industry, etc) through the interface of natural language
3) Making all of the world's knowledge semantically searchable, to accelerate that reasoning, has huge potential to democratize access to information 

If we're on the same page about the above, the next question is, how do we get there?

That's becoming more and more clear: the biggest bottleneck to more powerful, democratized artificial reasoning is the availability of high quality data. We can't sit around and wait for algorithmic improvements, and even when they come, the algorithms need to get their hands on as much specialized data as they can. Language models will get better at reasoning, and we'll get them into more places, but the majority of mission-critical, useful data is siloed and unstructured. In other words, the importance of increasing the amount of accessible, useful unstructured data is going exponential.

The goal of this memo is to activate and mobilize the ML & data community, the most important communities in the world's most important race. If we want to bring the future forward, if we want accelerate the proliferation of productive models, we need to coordinate. If we want to solve the big hairy problem - cure diseases, unbreak the economy, fix global crises, and make scientific breakthroughs, we need unstructured data to meet AI closer to where it's at.

"Progress in science depends on new techniques, new discoveries and new ideas, probably in that order" - Sidney Brenner

If we, as a community of engineers, scientists, and hackers, can come together and build a new set of tools. If we can improve humanities ability to make unstructured data more useful. And along the way, if we can encourage the liberation of private, siloed data, we can bring the future forward. 

The best way to encourage the liberation of private, siloed data is to:
1) make it easier (with amazing tools and shared standards)
2) create a tidal wave of momentum and social coordination aroung doing it
  
It's not going to be easy, it's not going to happen over night, but needles are going to be moved. 


### The Plan
Yet to be outlined


### A Few Things We Believe
- Every team will need a data engineer, or have some one who can effectively function as one
- Building better tools will close the gap faster than convincing more people to specialize in data engineering
- Open, community-led collaborative efforts are the way forward
- The data community holds untapped potential
- [Dataism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataism#:~:text=Dataism%20is%20a%20term%20that,New%20York%20Times%20in%202013) is sick

### Inspiration
- The Airbyte community, and the tools they've built for strucured data
- LlamaIndex & LangChain communities, and the frameworks they've built to make LLM apps more accessible
- Unstructured.io community, and their work with the public sector

### Principles
- Extensibility is key
- Maximize integrations, not by casting a wide net & shallow value, but through deep, generalizable frameworks
